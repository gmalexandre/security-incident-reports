## Project Overview

In this repository, you'll find the following projects:

- **Project 1**: Cybersecurity Incident Investigation - YummyRecipesForMe.com  
  In this project, I took on the role of a cybersecurity analyst for a website that was compromised through a brute force attack. The task was to investigate, identify, document, and recommend a solution to the security problem. I reviewed a tcpdump log to identify the network protocols used for communication and analyzed a security breach caused by a malicious actor embedding malware in the site.  
  Technologies used: tcpdump, DNS, HTTP, Brute Force Attack Mitigation.

- **Project 2**: DNS Resolution Investigation - YummyRecipesForMe.com
In this project, I analyzed network traffic logs to investigate issues related to DNS resolution for the domain yummyrecipesforme.com. The task involved examining repeated ICMP "Destination Port Unreachable" messages and identifying potential causes such as DNS server misconfiguration or network routing issues. I documented the findings, identified the root cause, and provided recommendations to resolve the incident effectively.
Technologies used: tcpdump, DNS, ICMP, Network Analysis.
